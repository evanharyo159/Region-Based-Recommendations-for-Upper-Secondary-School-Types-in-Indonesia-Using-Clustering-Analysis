# Region-Based-Recommendations-for-Upper-Secondary-School-Types-in-Indonesia-Using-Clustering-Analysis
This repository contains the data analysis and clustering models used to identify appropriate education pathways (general vs. vocational) for Indonesian cities and regencies based on socioeconomic data from 2019 to 2024.

## Project Structure
-   `Clustering Analysis to Determine Most Suitable School Type for Every Cities and Regions.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning, preprocessing, clustering analysis (including experimentation with K-Means and K-Medoids with various cluster numbers), and visualization.
-   `All Indonesia 19-24 new May.xlsx`: The raw socioeconomic dataset used for the analysis.
-   `All_Indonesia_Focus_Clustering.xlsx`: A preprocessed version of the dataset, generated by the notebook, which is used for the clustering analysis.

## Research Findings and Discussion

### Abstract Overview

Indonesia faces significant inequality in access to education between urban and rural areas, made more complex by its geographic and cultural diversity. With the government allowing students to choose between general and vocational upper secondary schools, it is crucial to guide them toward the most suitable path to support their future careers and ensure they can thrive in their own regions. This study analyzes all 514 Indonesian cities and regencies using socioeconomic data from 2019 to 2024 to identify appropriate education pathways.

### Clustering Methodology and Selection

The Jupyter Notebook (`Clustering Analysis to Determine Most Suitable School Type for Every Cities and Regions.ipynb`) experiments with both K-Means and K-Medoids clustering methods. Various numbers of clusters (`k`) were tested and evaluated using internal cluster validity indices. Through this experimental process, K-Means with five clusters was determined to produce the most robust and interpretable results for this dataset. This selection was based on a comprehensive evaluation presented within the notebook.

### Cluster Characteristics and Recommendations

The analysis resulted in five distinct clusters, each representing regions with unique socioeconomic profiles, leading to specific recommendations for upper secondary school types:

* **Cluster 0 (18 regions):** These regions are characterized by high technology use and rapid industry growth. They are **better suited for general education**, which typically prepares students for higher academic pursuits and careers in innovation-driven sectors.
* **Cluster 1 (211 regions):** Reflecting lower technology use and slower development, these regions are **more aligned with vocational education**. Vocational schools can provide practical skills directly applicable to local industries, fostering immediate employment opportunities.
* **Cluster 2 (5 regions):** Similar to Cluster 0, these regions also exhibit high technology adoption and significant industrial expansion. They are also **better suited for general education**, supporting a workforce capable of adapting to evolving technological landscapes.
* **Cluster 3 (194 regions):** Like Cluster 1, these regions show lower technological integration and slower economic development. They are **more aligned with vocational education**, which can directly address local labor market needs and promote regional economic stability.
* **Cluster 4 (86 regions):** This cluster displays mixed socioeconomic characteristics, indicating a blend of development levels and technology use. For these regions, a **balanced approach or further localized assessment** may be necessary to determine the optimal educational pathway, potentially involving a mix of general and vocational programs or specialized vocational training tailored to emerging local needs.

### Implications and Future Work

These findings can significantly help shape education policy in Indonesia by providing data-driven insights to match local conditions with appropriate educational offerings. By guiding students towards suitable paths, this research aims to support their future careers and ensure they can thrive within their own regions, ultimately contributing to more equitable access to education.

Future research should expand upon this analysis by including cultural and community-specific factors, which could further refine the recommendations and improve education equity across Indonesia.
